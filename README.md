Based on (mpm99.py)[], we could generate many kinds of objects dropping down from the top of console. The object could be generated from a texture image. I use [Pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/) to create the pixel images.

`read_texture.py` script can be used to generate 2D random points inside the pixel images boundaries. The coordinates of 2D random points is in range [0, 1.0). 

These random points can be used to initialize the material points.
